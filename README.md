# MyCookBook

MyCookBook is a web application that allows users to create and share their own recipes. Whether you are a professional or amateur chef, people can sometimes be forgetful and having a recipe written down on paper somewhere isn't always the best solution. Why not have your recipes anywhere you go, as long as you have an internet connection? If you have too many recipes to keep track of, this app is for you!

This repository is for the frontend source code for my fullstack MERN application. It was developed with React and uses Redux for state management. It uses Axios to send HTTP requests to my own REST API (source code link below). File storage is done directly from the frontend to Amazon S3. For component and page styling, I used Material UI. The frontend is hosted on Firebase.

You can try out the deployed app here: https://my-c00k-b00k.web.app/.

The source code for the backend can be viewed here: https://github.com/jgarcia2397/recipesBackend.
